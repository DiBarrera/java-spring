<!-- Overviwe -->
## Overviwe

In this repository you will find a brief summary of what was learned in the [platzi](https://platzi.com/cursos/java-spring/) course of Java Spring.

---------

With Java Spring you can develop projects with infrastructure support at the application level, providing a complete model for both configuration and programming. Spring stands out for its injection of dependencies, which helps to have classes that are independent of others, to increase the possibility of reusing them and testing them independently of other classes, while testing the units.

This repository is divided into the following parts.
* The steps to clone the repository and be able to view it.
* The main topics seen in the course
* Some of the basics concepts taught.
* Skills acquired at the end of the course.



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

### For this repository, IntelliJ Idea was used as IDE

### For this repository, Gradle was used as the build automation tool

### For this repository, The database that was used for the management of the information that will be exposed in the API was used PostgreSQL.
